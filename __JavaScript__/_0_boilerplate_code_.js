What is comment in JavaScript?
- Comments are lines in the code that are not executed. They are used to explain and clarify the code for anyone reading it, including the original developer.
- In JavaScript, comments can be single-line or multi-line.


Types of comments in JavaScript:
- Single-line comments: These comments start with // and continue to the end of the line.
        Example:
        // This is a single-line comment

- Multi-line comments: These comments start with /* and end with *\/. They can span multiple lines.
   Example:
        /*
        This is a multi-line comment
        It can span multiple lines
        */


// Why use comments?
// - Improve code readability: Comments help explain what the code does, making it easier for others (or yourself) to understand it later.
// - Documenting code: Comments can provide context, describe the purpose of functions, variables, and complex logic.
// - Debugging: Comments can be used to temporarily disable parts of the code during debugging.

What is boilerplate code in JavaScript?
- Boilerplate code in JavaScript refers to the standard or template code that is commonly used as a starting point for writing JavaScript programs or applications.
- This code provides a basic structure and setup that developers can build upon, saving time and effort by avoiding the need to write repetitive code from scratch.
- Boilerplate code often includes essential elements such as variable declarations, function definitions, event listeners, and other foundational components that are necessary for the program to function correctly.
- By using boilerplate code, developers can focus on implementing specific features and functionality rather than worrying about the initial setup and configuration of their JavaScript projects.
    // Example of JavaScript Boilerplate Code:
    // This boilerplate code sets up a basic structure for a JavaScript program.
    // Function to initialize the program
    function init() {
        // Code to be executed when the program starts
        console.log("Program initialized");
    }
    // Event listener for DOMContentLoaded to ensure the DOM is fully loaded before executing code
    document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function() {
        init(); // Call the init function when the DOM is ready
    });
    // This boilerplate code provides a starting point for building JavaScript applications, ensuring that the necessary setup is in place for further development.

// What is boilerplate code in html?
// HTML Boilerplate Code Explanation:

- Boilerplate code in HTML refers to the standard structure and elements that are commonly included in every HTML document. 
- This code provides a basic framework for the webpage, ensuring that it adheres to web standards and functions correctly across different browsers.
- This boilerplate code serves as a starting point for building any HTML document, providing the necessary structure and elements to ensure proper functionality and compatibility across web browsers.
   
    Here's an example of a basic HTML boilerplate:
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <title>Document Title</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <!-- Page content goes here -->
    </body>
    </html>


- A typical HTML boilerplate includes the following elements :-
- <!DOCTYPE html>: Declares the document type and version of HTML being used (HTML5 in this case).
- <html>: The root element that wraps all the content on the webpage.
- <head>: Contains meta-information about the document, such as character encoding, viewport settings, title, and links to stylesheets or scripts.
- <meta charset="UTF-8">: Specifies the character encoding for the document, ensuring that text is displayed correctly.
- <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">: Ensures proper scaling and responsiveness on different devices, especially mobile.
- <title>: Sets the title of the webpage, which appears in the browser tab.
- <body>: Contains the actual content of the webpage that users see and interact with.
