Explanation of console.log():
- The console.log() method is used to log(print) messages to the web console.
- It's commonly used for debugging purposes, allowing developers to see the values of variables or the flow of execution in their code.

To break down exactly how it works:
- console is the toolbox that holds the developer tools.
- The dot (.) is how you reach inside the toolbox to pick a specific tool.
- log is the specific tool you picked. Its only job is to print whatever you give it.
- So console.log() means: "Go to the console toolbox, take out the 'log' tool, and use it to print this.

where is console toolbox?
- In web browsers, the console toolbox is part of the developer tools. You can usually open it by right-clicking on a webpage, selecting "Inspect" 
  or "Inspect Element," and then navigating to the "Console" tab.
- In Node.js, the console is available in the terminal or command prompt where you run your Node.js scripts.

Important note:
- The console toolbox is not in your webpage. It's a separate panel inside your web browser, made only for developers.
- You open it by right-clicking on a webpage and selecting "Inspect" or by pressing F12 on your keyboard. The "Console" tab inside that panel 
  is where the messages from console.log() appear. Regular visitors to the site do not see it.
